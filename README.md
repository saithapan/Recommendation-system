# Recommendation-system

For First project Weighted hybrid technique

-> Load the data
-> Merge the two files with they common id
-> clean the data which is not required 
-> check the data if any null value exists or not
-> For imdb website we get the weight formula
-> In the dataset there are also provided the popularity 
-> so the recommendation will show 50% from weight score and 50% from the popularaity

For KNN movie recommendation project
AIM:- Giving similar recommendations to the user who give somerating to the movie  
-> Load the data
-> Merge the two files with they common id
-> clean the data which is not required 
-> Now calculate the total # number ratings given for each movie 
-> Setting some threshold value from histogram for total number of rating
-> creating pivot matrix
-> Knn use euclidean distance to find distance inside that we will use cosine similarity
